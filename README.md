Teaching your baby to know common foods is an important step for your baby to know life and know the world. In addition, teach your baby to distinguish common foods, and also exercise your baby's observation and memory skills. This app encourages your baby to quickly recognize food and accumulate Chinese and English words through vivid Chinese and English pronunciation and graphics.
